## HAIF Framework (Human–AI Framework)

Learning is organised into six conceptual worlds:

1. Sensing World – How machines collect inputs
2. Knowledge World – How machines store information
3. Logic World – How machines make decisions
4. Communication World – Human–AI interaction
5. Pattern World – Pattern recognition
6. Ethics World – Responsible AI use

Each world spans multiple levels.
Depth increases with grade.
Structure remains constant.
