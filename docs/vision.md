## Vision

Rooted Labs exists to build AI literacy without screens-first dependency.

The platform prioritises:
- Thinking over tools
- Experience over explanation
- Human facilitation before automation

Rooted Labs supports:
- B2B (Schools, teacher-led)
- B2C (Homes, system-led)
- Future AI-augmented learning

Core principle:
Content stays constant.
Structure stays constant.
Only the controller changes.
