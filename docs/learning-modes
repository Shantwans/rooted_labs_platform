## Learning Modes

Rooted Labs operates using a **parallel learning model**, not a gated one.

Learning happens on two tracks:
- Digital Learning (self-paced, student-led)
- Sense-Making (human-facilitated, non-blocking)

Access to digital content is never restricted by mode.
Modes only affect **recognition and validation**, not access.

---

### 1. School Mode (B2B)

- Students access all digital content freely
- Teachers facilitate discussion and unplugged activities
- Teachers confirm completion of sense-making
- Teacher actions do NOT unlock or block digital steps

In School Mode:
- Digital Explorer and Thinker badges are earned by students independently
- Sense Maker badge is confirmed by the teacher
- Level completion may require all badges, depending on school policy

---

### 2. Home Mode (B2C)

- Students access all digital content freely
- No teacher dependency
- System rules handle recognition:
  - digital completion
  - visual thinking quiz score

In Home Mode:
- Digital Explorer and Thinker badges are system-awarded
- Sense Maker badge may be skipped or parent-supported
- Learning progression remains uninterrupted

---

### 3. AI Mode (Future)

- AI augments recognition and support, not access
- AI analyses:
  - digital interaction patterns
  - visual thinking responses
  - sense-making confirmations

AI does NOT replace the learning structure.
It only enhances feedback and personalisation.

⚠️ Mode changes do NOT change content or level structure.
Only the **controller of validation** changes.
